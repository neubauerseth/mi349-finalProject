# mi349-finalProject
This is my Final Project for my MI 349 Class

# Overview
For the MI 349 final project you will be required to create a multi-page personal or business website using the tools you've learned this semester. The site should be complete–from and copy and a development standpoint–and fully hosted on a Netlify domain. The personal aspect of the site can be anything you choose. Most students put together a portfolio, resume, or informational page about themselves–but the choice is yours.

# Attention to Detail
The most important part of the final project is your attention to detail in the work. Because it's only a small site, it's important that your writing be thoughtful and clear, the images you use be professional, and the overall quality of your markup and style be high. Part of your grade will be basic requirements (e.g. does this pass a validation test), the other part will be subjective and graded based on overall effort and quality of the final work.

# Requirements
### Your final project must include the following:

- A brand and full prototype created in Figma (min 4 pages)
- Four (4) fully valid HTML5 pages
- One separate, linked, fully valid CSS document for your styles
- Two images (relative link, source must be within your project)
- Thoughtful copywriting (see rubric below; concise, clear writing that communicates the goals of the site to the visitor)
- No spelling or grammatical errors
- Thoughtful design that follows the MI 349 Design Principles (see rubric below)
- The design should be intentional.
- The design should have a clear style and color palette
- The final site should be responsive and render correctly on mobile devices
- All source code must be in a new GitHub repository
- The final site must be hosted on Netlify

- Your writing will be subjectively graded based on quality; here's what I'm looking for:
    - Did you communicate your ideas in a simple, clear way?
    - Is your writing applicable to your audience?

- Here are some good tips and guidelines [link](https://digital.gov/topics/usability/)
- Design (quality scoring) (100 points)
- Your design will be subjectively graded based on quality; here's what I'm looking for:
    - Does your design show effort and forethought?
    - Is it esthetic (does it follow the class design principles)?
    - Does it accomplish the goals of the site?
    - Does it use a common CSS layout technique?
- I will be fair with subjective grading and I will apply the same standards across all projects. If you have any issues with the subjective portion of your grade, you can always reach out for clarification.
